# *NN_Deep_Learning_Projects

1. Keras Project - House Sales in King County, USA
Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. 
It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.  

## *Build a NN model that predicts house price based on its features.** 


2. 	Keras_Classification Project - Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset.
This is a copy of UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets. https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2

Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class. 

## *Build a NN model that predicts class either to malignant or benign using 30 numeric predictive attributes.**  

3. Keras_Capstone_Project - DataSet of the LendingClub obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

Project's aim is by using historical data on loans given out with loan_status information ('fully paid' or 'charged off'),

## *Build a model that can predict will borrower pay back their loan or not.**

This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.**
